- CSS Grid

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of
  using grid and flexbox
</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  This is was my first time to make site look responsive, I can't believe that I made 
  a mobile version of this siteðŸŽ‰
}
```

### Continued development

I have to continue working on projects which include css grids and flexbox
